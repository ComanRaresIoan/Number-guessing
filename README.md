This is a game of guessing a number chosen by the computer. It can provide the following capabilities:
1. Interval Selection: The user is prompted to input two numbers, which define an interval (left and right borders).
2. Interval Validation: The code checks if the left border is less than the right border. If not, it swaps the values to ensure a valid interval.
3. Random Number Generation: A random number within the specified interval is generated.
4. Guessing Game: The user is given a certain number of attempts to guess the randomly generated number.
5. User Input Handling: The program prompts the user to input a guess. It checks if the input is a valid integer and within the specified interval.
6. Feedback: The program provides feedback on whether the guessed number is smaller or greater than the random number.
7. Game End: The game continues until the user correctly guesses the number or exhausts all attempts.
8.Outcome Display: The program displays whether the user guessed the correct number or, if attempts are exhausted, reveals the correct number.
